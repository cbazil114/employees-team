## Installation
You will need dependencies such as Inquirer and Jest. Use npm i after cloning from the public repo to gain the necessary dependencies. 

## Usage
Once a user accesses the node index.js in their command line, they will be presented with a series of questions, utilizing Inquirer. You will then answer questions for each member of your team until there is no one left to add.
